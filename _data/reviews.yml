  review: "The design is so clever! My daughter loves that she can build her reading nook anywhere there's a floor vent. We've printed 4 of these for different rooms. Easy print, no supports needed."

  review: "Minnesota winters are brutal. Used this to redirect heat to my workshop in the garage. The snap-fit is solid and the seal is surprisingly airtight. Would love to see a 6\" version!"

  review: "Great concept and works well. Printed in PLA and had to reprint in PETG for better heat resistance near the vent. One star off because the instructions could mention material choice more prominently."

  review: "I'm a 3D printing hobbyist and this is one of the most practical prints I've done. The tolerances are spot-on for standard dryer vent hoses. Used it to improve airflow to my filament dry box!"

  review: "My grandkids think Grandma is a genius now. The clips work perfectly with fleece blankets and the vents provide just enough airflow to keep the fort comfortable. Printed as a gift for each grandkid!"

  review: "Creative solution for my weird HVAC setup. The adapter fits standard 4\"x10\" floor vents perfectly. I daisy-chained it with 8 feet of flex duct to heat my bathroom better. Works great!"
