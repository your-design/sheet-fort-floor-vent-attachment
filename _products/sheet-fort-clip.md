The Sheet Fort Clip Attachment transforms any standard floor vent into a secure anchor point for blankets and sheets. Perfect for building epic indoor forts, reading nooks, or cozy hideaways.

## How It Works

The attachment consists of two main components: a base plate that snaps onto your existing floor vent, and an integrated spring-loaded clip that securely holds fabric. The clever design maintains airflow from your HVAC system while providing a stable attachment point.

Simply remove your existing vent cover, snap the attachment in place, and clip your sheet or blanket into the integrated holder. The warm air from your heating system will gently inflate your fort while keeping the interior cozy.

## Design Philosophy

We designed this with kids in mind. All edges are rounded and smooth. The clip mechanism uses gentle spring tension that won't pinch little fingers. The attachment sits flush with the floor to prevent tripping hazards.

The snap-fit base uses no screws or adhesives—it friction-fits into the vent opening and can be removed in seconds when you need to access the vent or pack up the fort.

## Material Considerations

While PLA will work for occasional use, we recommend PETG for this print. Floor vents can reach temperatures of 100-120°F (38-49°C) when the heat is running, which approaches PLA's glass transition temperature. PETG handles these temperatures without issue and offers better long-term durability.

For outdoor use or high-traffic areas, consider ASA or ABS for UV resistance and impact strength.

## Scaling for Different Vent Sizes

The provided STL is sized for the most common 4" × 10" floor vents. If you have a different size vent, you can scale the model in your slicer:

- **6" × 10" vents**: Scale to 150% on the X axis only
- **4" × 12" vents**: Scale to 120% on the Y axis only
- **6" × 12" vents**: Scale both axes proportionally

The STEP file is provided for those who want to modify the design in CAD software for custom vent sizes or to add their own attachment mechanisms.
