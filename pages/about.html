      <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
      
      <p>VentSnap started the way many projects do—with a kid who wanted a blanket fort and a parent who wanted it to work better.</p>
      
      <p>The problem with blanket forts is keeping them up. Chairs fall over, clips don't grip, and the whole thing collapses right when the hot chocolate arrives. But there's this unused resource right there in the floor: the HVAC vent. What if the vent could be an anchor point? What if the warm air could inflate the fort like a gentle bounce house?</p>
      
      <p>The Sheet Fort Clip was born. Then came the inevitable question: what else could you attach to a floor vent? The Round Duct Adapter followed shortly after, solving a completely different problem—redirecting airflow to a cold home office.</p>
      
      <h2>Open Source Philosophy</h2>
      
      <p>Everything here is open source under the MIT license. Download it, modify it, sell prints of it, fork it, improve it. We believe in the power of shared solutions.</p>
      
      <p>The designs are provided as both STL (ready to print) and STEP (ready to modify) files. If you create an improvement or new attachment, we'd love to see it. Submit a pull request on GitHub or just share it with the community.</p>
      
      <h2>Design Principles</h2>
      
      <h3>Print-Friendly First</h3>
      <p>Every design is optimized for FDM printing without supports. We don't assume everyone has a multi-material printer or wants to spend hours on post-processing.</p>
      
      <h3>Standard Components</h3>
      <p>When hardware is needed, we use standard sizes available at any hardware store. No exotic fasteners, no special order parts.</p>
      
      <h3>Real-World Tested</h3>
      <p>Every design gets tested in actual homes before release. We print prototypes, install them, use them for weeks, and iterate until they work reliably.</p>
      
      <h3>Material Appropriate</h3>
      <p>We specify materials based on actual operating conditions, not just what prints easiest. If PETG is required, we say so and explain why.</p>
      
      <h2>Contributing</h2>
      
      <p>There are several ways to contribute to VentSnap:</p>
      
      <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
        <li><strong>Submit bug reports</strong> if a design doesn't fit or function as expected</li>
        <li><strong>Share improvements</strong> via pull request on GitHub</li>
        <li><strong>Create new attachments</strong> using the standardized base interface</li>
        <li><strong>Write documentation</strong> or improve existing guides</li>
        <li><strong>Share your builds</strong> to help others see what's possible</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Roadmap</h2>
      
      <p>Current priorities for future development:</p>
      
      <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
        <li><strong>6" Round Adapter:</strong> Larger duct connection for high-flow applications</li>
        <li><strong>Y-Splitter:</strong> Split one vent into two smaller ducts</li>
        <li><strong>Adjustable Damper:</strong> Control airflow with an integrated blade</li>
        <li><strong>Wall Vent Versions:</strong> Adapt the designs for sidewall registers</li>
        <li><strong>Metric Sizing:</strong> Versions sized for European/Asian standard vents</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>License</h2>
